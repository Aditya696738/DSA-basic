# C++ Practice Problems

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate C++ code samples, each demonstrating fundamental concepts and programming patterns. The files and examples are designed for learning, experimentation, and revision of C++ basics.

## Contents

### 1. `array..cpp`
- Demonstrates array initialization, accessing elements, finding addresses, calculating sum, min/max values, and size of arrays.
- Includes commented code snippets for various array operations.

### 2. `fibonacci.cpp`
- Shows how to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
- Includes functions for generating n-th Fibonacci number and printing the series.

### 3. `function.cpp`
- Contains sample functions for:
  - Prime checking
  - Calculating n-th term of a sequence
  - Even/odd number checking
  - Calculating factorial and nCr (combinations)

### 4. `patterns.cpp`
- Provides code for printing basic patterns using loops:
  - Square patterns
  - Number patterns
- More pattern examples can be added.

### 5. `switch-case.cpp`
- Demonstrates switch-case control structure.
- Program to split a given amount into currency denominations based on user choice.
